        <div class="container">
            <p>signalis is a very good game. i don't think i need to reiterate that too many times. it's got everything;
                <b>anti-capitalism</b>, <b>cosmic horror</b>, and of course, <b>severely tragic lesbians.</b></p>
            <p>if you haven't yet played it, <strong>go buy it (or pirate it) and play it right this fucking
                    instant</strong>. i cannot and will not claim to do as much justice as playing the damn game
                yourself.</p>
            <p>if you're a bit of a bitch when it comes to horror like i am, don't worry - the horror is in the eternal
                sadness, far more than it is in jumpscares. it's far more creepy than it is horror focused, and 99% of
                the jumpscares
                aren't really that - they're a loud screech from an enemy you can see, and an enemy you can
                <b>fight.</b></p>
            <p>so yes go buy it right this instant. i'll even include a little steam embed just to minimise the amount
                of clicks this takes.</p>

                is <b>ariane</b>, and you've lived a pretty shit, miserable life.</p>

            </figure><br/>
            <p>you grew up on a shithole planet, in a frigid apartment block. you see, ariane lives in a state that is
                communist (the cringe, stalinist, eastern german kind,
                instead of the gay luxury automated space communism- we'll get to that in a bit). she lives in the
                <b>eusan state</b>, aka "what a republican imagines communism to be"</p>
            <p>these guys follow the stereotypes to a tee. anti-conformity is a terrible misnomer. so much so that, as
                both a justification of a game mechanic and an extension of the game's fetish with the number
                <b class="horus">six</b> (we'll get to that too), a worker is only permitted to carry <b
                    class="horus">six</b> items on their person at a time. wowie zowie! this place fucking sucks!
            </p>
            <p>the eusan state has been at war with the eusan kingdom, the other major player in the solar system, for a
                long ass time. one of the planets, <b>vineta</b>, was almost certainly glassed during the war. these two
                really fucking hate each other</p>
            <p>there's a pervasive feeling, both aesthetically and thematically throughout, that whether the eusan's
                were right in their revolution or not doesn't matter all that much anymore. they're making a mockery of
                their ideals, their statehood, and their people.
                among them, of course, is ariane. ariane lives on <b>rotfront</b> - killer name for a planet, btw -
                which is a frozen shithole. she grew up with her mother out at a remote listening post on her homeworld,
                <b>leng</b>, but now she lives in an urban blockwart, gets bullied at school,
                and is generally not living a great life. and then, after all that, she gets a work assignment from the
                state. fantastic! finally, an escape from this despicable piece of shit-</p>
            <code class="horus"><b>aeon facility re-education facility sierpinski s-23 - mine worker</b></code>
            <p>ariane's military service and past life collide. the state wants to send her to a re-education camp. she
                will most likely die there.</p>
            <p>so! in a last ditch effort, she joins...</p>

            </figure><br/>
            <p><b>the penrose programme</b> plans to send the nation's best and brightest on a long burn out of the solar
                system, in search of new planets and new life. without many other options, ariane reaches out, and
                succeeds!
                she is assigned to penrose-512, along with a replika partner, lstr-512.</p>
            <p>replikas- they're androids, but the question of their sentience is not one to be answered in this game.
                they are patently people, whether the state considers them such or not. they're also created, in part,
                through the use of psychic powers (called <b>bioresonence</b> - we'll get to it) on powerful "gestalts"
                - what the game calls non-replika humans
                the lstr unit is derived from a soldier, a revolutionary, who fought on <b>vineta</b>, perhaps long ago,
                during the early days of the revolution.</p>
            <p>regardless of her co-pilot's capacity and concerns, there is one thing above all that all the manuals
                tell ariane - she is not to form a bond with the lstr. it is a tool, first and foremost.</p>
            <p>i'm sure you can see exactly where this went.</p>

                with only each other, fell in love. and it was beautiful.</p>

            <p>this i think is one of the most important aspects of <b>signalis</b>. not just because of the yuri (god i love yuri) but also because ariane and lstr-512 - elster, her name is elster - spend <b>years</b> of their life together. just the two of them, finding companionship and joy and love and life in a tiny sarcophagus on the edge of space. for ariane, this is freedom; she is herself and free to be herself, forever and ever and ever. for elster, she is free too, even if she doesn't yet know it.</p>
