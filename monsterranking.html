                        pipeline punch fucking rocks. it's one of those flavours that you can only really identify as itself.

                    <p>if you're british you've probably had <b>appletiser</b> before, right? <i>what the fuck it was invented in the apartheid state of south africa?</i> anyways, point is if you suck like i do you've definitely had it
                        appletiser is a perculiar type of taste. it tastes as if it's met the ghost of an apple before, or that it itself murdered the apple and what you're drinking is the blood that it wiped away.
                        that isn't to say it's not strong, but the flavour of apple is closer to that of <b>apple sourz</b> than actual apple. it's this fake sort of apple, the kind you might find in a maoam or something but ten times worse
                        because it's carbonated and most carbonation tastes like ass.</p>
                    <p>monster bad apple tastes like that kind of apple. it's a drink that wants to be so cool and edgy and like evil snow white before gal godot got brought in to ruin that entire movie 
                        (yes it was gonna be bad either way. no adding a zionist does not help). yet all i feel whilst drinking it is a resounding "meh". at its worst it makes me want to start drinking apple sourz again
                        which is the opposite of pleasant (apple sourz are disgustingly easy to drink), but at its best its hardly delicious. it tastes far more like the energy than the drink.</p>

                    <p>apparently this is a rebranded flavour of the original khaotic from 2021? i've never had the original and frankly never will. although it'd be really funny if i found a can. if i do i will make a seperate review of it.</p>
                    <p>anyways it tastes like orange. <b>wow</b>, i know. though, it tastes specifically like an orange lollipop, with the same fake orange after taste and all. 
                        luckily for this flavour, orange fucks hard and will never go wrong. it does, however, smell despicable. when people say energy drinks smell like battery acid, i have to assume this is what they mean. 
                        the name is also fucking stupid lmao. the k just makes me think of khaos emeralds and i don't even fucking like sonic. the can also looks like my piss will after a few more entries into this list.</p>

                    <p>ultra fiesta mango tastes like the blood of a guy who's eaten 16,000 mangos. like there's a lot of mangoes going on here but it all tastes vaguely off. is it because it's sugar free? i would have to guess so. i don't feel less guilty drinking one, if that was the intention, because it's just as fucking sweet as any other monster.</p>
                    <p>but oh wow does it gets worse the more you drink it. the after taste is vile and makes the regular sip by sip taste worse by the minute, like the acid from the artificial sugars is turning my tongue into wasteland and covering it in mango-flavoured bacon grease.</p>
                    <p>ultra fiesta is what i assume mango loco tastes like if someone diluted it with 2 percent piss. the taste will not leave my mouth, even writing this now several hours after drinking it. absolutely vile.</p>

                    <p>alright this was the most hyped up monster on the docket. the beautiful, the astounding, the mango-ific mango loco monster. i've heard raving reviews from other people and i was completely willing to believe it. i'm
                        pretty sure its <b>most</b> peoples' favourite flavour.</p>
                    <p>so what did i, the growing monster queen™, think?</p>
                    <p>'sgood.</p>
                    <p>like fr it's a really good flavour. ofc it is. are you stupid? mango fucking rocks. it's a delicious fruit in pretty much any form, and monster mango loco is no different</p>
                    <p>the question must then become a matter of ranking mango loco against <b>other mango products</b>, rather than other monsters. so how does it rank up? well, it <i>does</i> have an acrid after-taste that i've never experienced from anything else mango,
                    which i have to assume is the classic monster battery acid flavour. this automatically docks it a few points, because the only monster i've ever tried which dodges the majority of that flavour is the goat, pipey punch. but even in comparison to other mango drinks
                    mango loco just doesn't hold up. consider the delightful classic, mango lassi. they're very different drinks, obviously - one being primarily yoghurt and milk, the other being a carbonated caffeine sugar high in a colourful can (don't get a caffeine addiction, kids!)
                    but when i think of mango flavour, the sheer joy of a cool mango lassi is always my first port of call. and in the illustrious halls of mango lassi, mango loco just does not hold up.</p>
                    <p>to its absolute credit, mango loco soars where ultra fiesta crashed several layers into the pits of hell (at least floor sixth, where the heretic sods ended up). i want to make it abundantly clear - mango loco clears the good name of mango in the eyes of the monster gods (me)
                        but it just cannot compare to other monsters themselves. i.e., it is no pipey.

                    better than fiesta by a wide margin, and temporarily heals my strained relationship with mango. but it simply cannot dethrone the girl water.

                    <p>rio punch is definitely tasty, but i don't know if that's a positive. i've only ever had gushers once in my life, but the anton ego flashback scene to that day crashed upon me like pigeons to breadcrumbs as i was drinking this. 
                        the smell is intense and the flavour, equally so; it never lets up.</p>
                    <p>fun izzy lore fact; technically, rio punch was one of the first flavours of monster i ever tried - a friend of mine gave me a sip when i was exhausted and i described it as, quote, "the sweetest thing on earth".</p>
                    <p>i don't agree with my past self now, having tried things like mango loco and my darling pipey, but it's certainly up there in terms of saccharinity (which is apparently a word!). there's this fake sugar flavour that i think is coming from the papaya, but it's not an ultra, so i have no idea what in the zero-sugar fuck's actually causing that acrid, mimicry taste.</p> 
                    <p>frankly, i think apple, white grape, papaya, and mango is an odd combo that struggles to become cohesive. it tastes <i>fine</i>, but not good or particularly enjoyable.</p>

                    <p> as with all ultras, the aftertaste of strawberry dreams is anything but - it's more like a flavour nightmare meant to trigger my tastebuds specifically, like a porcelain doll with the face of bonnie five nights at freddy's on it.</p>
                    <p>but i'm surprised just how pleasant the strawberry itself actually is. usually, fake strawberry tastes like total fucking ass - i should know, one time i ate strawberry lube on toast and the experience was deeply unpleasant (the lube had nothing to do with it)</p>
                    <p>this strawberry tastes, honestly, quite fresh and relieving. it was never gonna be great, or even particularly good for that matter, because of the curse of the house of ultra, but within that space, it's decent. </p>
                    <p>oh, it does start to get worse though after drinking enough of it. the after taste was getting so rancid that i had to drink down sips with water, like it was a less child friendly medicine than calpol. whilst i didn't end up pouring it away like the mango fiesta, it was a continuous uphill battle</p>
