        <p>if you follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/izzythewikiwitch.bsky.social">bluesky</a> (you really should btw, i'm hilarious) you would know that i've got a penchant 
            for pipeline punch. the <b>trans girl's monster</b>. but what about the other flavours? i'm gonna be reviewing all the <b>flavours of monster</b> here for no particular reason beyond "i wanna". 
            i do not currently have a caffeine addiction but i'm willing to learn!</p>

                    <p>first things first, the baseline. no i refuse to use the classic monster as the baseline. i hear that's
                        the mark of the devil!!
                        pipeline punch fucking rocks. it's one of those flavours that you can only really identify as itself.
                        you know how coke only tastes like coke, or dr pepper only tastes like pepper? yeah it's got that going
                        on
                        but unlike those bastards this is the premier Trans Girl Juiceâ„¢. i have anecdotally met so many trans
                        girls who drink pipeline religiously, myself included. i think tbf though the strength of my beloved pp
                        is that
                        orange and passionfruit is an inherently goated flavour. those two citruses (is passionfruit a citrus?
                        idk enough to check) are delicious on their own and together the make this fucked up sort of union.</p>
                    <p>oh. of course. this too is yuri.</p>
                    <p>anyways aside from that the bottle is a pretty colour and it no longer gives me the shakes, so that's
                        something!!</p>

                    <p>if you're british you've probably had <b>appletiser</b> before, right? <i>what the fuck it was invented in the apartheid state of south africa?</i> anyways, point is if you suck like i do you've definitely had it
                        appletiser is a perculiar type of taste. it tastes as if it's met the ghost of an apple before, or that it itself murdered the apple and what you're drinking is the blood that it wiped away.
                        that isn't to say it's not strong, but the flavour of apple is closer to that of <b>apple sourz</b> than actual apple. it's this fake sort of apple, the kind you might find in a maoam or something but ten times worse
                        because it's carbonated and most carbonation tastes like ass.</p>
                    <p>monster bad apple tastes like that kind of apple. it's a drink that wants to be so cool and edgy and like evil snow white before gal godot got brought in to ruin that entire movie 
                        (yes it was gonna be bad either way. no adding a zionist does not help). yet all i feel whilst drinking it is a resounding "meh". at its worst it makes me want to start drinking apple sourz again
                        which is the opposite of pleasant (apple sourz are disgustingly easy to drink), but at its best its hardly delicious. it tastes far more like the energy than the drink.</p>
