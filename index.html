                aight so. imagine this. the uk government doesn't want children to see nudity online. <i>"sure. fair
                    enough."</i> you think.
                so the government starts checking everyone's id. gotta prove you're an adult to be an adult online.
                <i>"sure. fair enough."</i> you think.
                then you find out the government is gonna be checking this <b>id</b> through a system ran by <b>EPIC
                    GAMES</b>. yk. the fortnite people.<br />
                you're reasonable, so you ask <i>"what? huh? why the fuck?"</i>
                this was me creating this website. simply put; i'm <b>fucking sick</b> of my data being treated like a
                plaything, especially sensitive data like my <b>FUCKING PASSPORT</b> and other id documents.
                as a trans woman, this does not make me feel safe and secure online. as a person <b>GENERALLY</b>, it
                does not make me feel safe online. and, knowing how
                deeply ineffectual government responses to children's spaces online are, <b>this will do yet more harm
                    than good</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                so. what the fuck am i gonna do about it? learn web development? well it seems like the people in charge
                weren't banking on the fact that i'm autistically interested
                in protecting myself and my data. so yes. here is a website. i will use it for things and creating
                things. please enjoy.
