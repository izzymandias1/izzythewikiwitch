                aight so. imagine this. the uk government doesn't want children to see nudity online. <i>"sure. fair
                    enough."</i> you think.
                so the government starts checking everyone's id. gotta prove you're an adult to be an adult online.
                <i>"sure. fair enough."</i> you think.
                then you find out the government is gonna be checking this <b>id</b> through a system ran by <b>EPIC
                    GAMES</b>. yk. the fortnite people.<br />
                you're reasonable, so you ask <i>"what? huh? why the fuck?"</i>
                this was me creating this website. simply put; i'm <b>fucking sick</b> of my data being treated like a
                plaything, especially sensitive data like my <b>FUCKING PASSPORT</b> and other id documents.
                as a trans woman, this does not make me feel safe and secure online. as a person <b>GENERALLY</b>, it
                does not make me feel safe online. and, knowing how
                deeply ineffectual government responses to children's spaces online are, <b>this will do yet more harm
                    than good</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                so. what the fuck am i gonna do about it? learn web development? well it seems like the people in charge
                weren't banking on the fact that i'm autistically interested
                in protecting myself and my data. so yes. here is a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                just to show off my power, here is a picture of a boob (and also a penis too! woagh!).
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary> click if you want. or don't. that's the point of consent, eh? </summary>
                <img class="imgfocus" src="images/boobies_with_a_point.png"
                alt="a character with boobs and a penis. it's fucking awesome."
                width="200" />
                <p>yippie, a naked woman!!</p>
            </details>
            <p>
                incredible, i know. this is what the uk government wants to take away from us. and by that i mean, there's a <b>LOT</b> of people who are very,
                very interested in ensuring that anything they deem "pornographic" has no place on the internet. the above is a naked woman. to say it's pornographic isn't just transmisogynistic and sexist more generally,
                but also just kinda weirdo shit? i have made art and there are many who are convinced that that art is inherently immoral.
            </p>
            <p>
                really, we should've left "i know it when i see it" politics back in the 80s. we also shouldn't be handing out ids over to any institution, least of which a foreign company that runs
                fucking <b>fortnite</b>. so, if you want to see nsfw things (or anything, really) from me, keep an eye here.
            </p><br/>
