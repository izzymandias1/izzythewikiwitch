            <h2>the sojourn</h2>
            <h3>teldrani</h3>
            <p>i created <b>teldrani</b> for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thesojourn.bsky.social">the sojourn audio
                    drama</a>.<br />
                teldrani is a conlang primarily based on japanese, with sprinkles of arabic and welsh in there too
                (because i hate you and myself).<br />
                it has been included in things such as <a href="https://youtu.be/pWOtJY9d2nY">a lore short</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.thesojournaudiodrama.com">the audio drama</a> itself.
                many actors have suffered it and i thank them from all from the bottom of my heart.
            </p>
            <h3>voice acting</h3>
            <p>my many illustrious roles in the sojourn include; <br />
            <ul>
                <li>a cool trans engineer who only speaks teldrani (the language i made up, remember?) in <a
                        href="https://www.thesojournaudiodrama.com/s01v03">season 1, episode 9.</a></li>
                <li>a comms officer in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdHPwPfHXlI">frontier war episode 1:
                        battle of addicus.</a></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>art</h3>
            <p>i've also done a few art pieces on commission from the sojourn audio drama (they are the only people who
                have ever so consistently paid me for my work, thanks lads).
                you can see them in various works in the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnNVFgDJ3vWZ7kffVPrisfmQWLBbJIcU">worlds of tantalus
                    series</a></p>

            <h2>stardust</h2>
            <h3>astrilish</h3>
            <p>i created <b>astrilish</b> for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thestarsaredestiny.com">stardust</a>. it's a mixture between swedish, french, and (because of course), japanese. you can see it in the first book of the eponymous series <i>stardust</i>, coming eventually, and read out by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vandomva.bsky.social">alexis vandom</a> and the other narrators of that project.</p>
            <h3>editing</h3>
            <p>i've been editing with the creator of <a
                    href="https://bsky.app/profile/thestarsaredestiny.com">stardust</a>, <a
                    href="https://bsky.app/profile/faithfalkner.com">faith falkner</a>, for basically as long as she's
                been talking about it. it's a story that i adore and i'm happy that she trusts me to help edit it into
                shape.<br />
                i do a bit of everything as an editor, including, but not limited to, line-editing, story-editing, first
                draft approval, and so forth</p>

            <h3>character art</h3>
            <p>i've done a lot of character art for a variety of people. yes i draw furry art. please commission me. you
                people pay so kindly for artist's work and i respect the furry community more than 90% of the internet
                because of it. you guys looked at the concept of ai and found it so repulsive you started paying real
                artists <b>MORE</b>. love u all.</p>
            <h3>vector art</h3>
            <p>i've created logos and concept designs for people both paid and for free (when I was young and stupid)
